# MVL Benchmark Generator

Generate Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) ALU Benchmarks using Large Language Models.

## Features

- Support for multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, Qwen, Together AI)
- Generate MVL ALU code in C, Python, Verilog, VHDL
- Support K-values from 2 to 7
- Support bitwidths: 8, 10, 12, 14 trits
- Built-in simulation runner (GCC, Python, Icarus Verilog)
